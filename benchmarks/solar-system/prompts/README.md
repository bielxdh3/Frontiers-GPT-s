# Prompt archive

Prompts are immutable benchmark inputs. A run is only fully auditable when the exact prompt used for that run is preserved verbatim and its provenance is explicit.

| Prompt | Used by | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`sun-original.md`](./sun-original.md) | GPT-5.6 Sun Max V1 historical baseline | ✅ Archived verbatim |
| [`frontier-v2.md`](./frontier-v2.md) | GPT-5.6 Sun Max V2; GPT-6 Astra Max; Grok 4.6 XHIGH; Fable 5.1 Max | ✅ Archived verbatim + integrity verified |

## Frontier V2 integrity record

The shared Frontier V2 prompt was supplied as `solar-system-master-prompt.md` and archived without summarization, normalization, rewriting or reconstruction.

## Benchmark meaning

```text
                       EXACT SAME FRONTIER V2 PROMPT
               ↙                ↓               ↓               ↘
      SUN MAX V2         ASTRA MAX        GROK 4.6          FABLE 5.1
         MAX                MAX              XHIGH               MAX
```

The older `sun-original.md` remains preserved separately for historical prompt-leverage analysis and is not part of the current Frontier V2 arena.

## Integrity rule

Prompt text must never be reconstructed from memory, summarized, improved after the fact or inferred from a produced application. If an exact source cannot be recovered, the benchmark must say so rather than fabricate certainty.

Reasoning-effort labels are recorded independently from prompt integrity. `Max` and `XHIGH` identify the settings used for those runs; they are not normalized into a cross-vendor compute scale.

## Why prompts live outside run folders

The run folders contain model-produced artifacts. Prompt inputs live here so that:

- the same input can be linked to multiple runs without duplication drift;
- comparisons can distinguish prompt quality from model output quality;
- later reviewers can reproduce the experiment without inspecting unrelated source files;
- prompt revisions are explicit benchmark versions rather than hidden edits inside model code;
- integrity metadata can be checked independently of the projects that consumed the prompt.
