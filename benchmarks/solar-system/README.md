## ⚔️ Current Frontier V2 arena

| Model | Effort | Live project | Snapshot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ☀️ **GPT-5.6 Sun Max** | Max | [Open Sun V2](https://gpt-5.6-sun-v2.biel.dev.br) | `93d43ae62f…` |
| ✦ **GPT-6 Astra Max** | Max | [Open Astra](https://gpt-6-astra.biel.dev.br) | `fca2ef51b4…` |
| 𝕏 **Grok 4.6** | **XHIGH** | [Open Grok 4.6](https://grok-4-6-solar-system.vercel.app) | archive `5d77eeb509…` |
| ◆ **Fable 5.1** | **Max** | [Open Fable 5.1](https://fable-solar-system.vercel.app) | `7e079669e41b…` |

All four current contenders use the exact same [`frontier-v2.md`](./prompts/frontier-v2.md) input.

> Reasoning labels are preserved exactly as run metadata. `Max` and `XHIGH` are vendor/run settings and are not treated as directly equivalent compute scales.

<summary><strong>Historical baseline — GPT-5.6 Sun Max V1</strong></summary>

GPT-5.6 Sun Max V1 is preserved only for prompt-leverage history. It is deliberately excluded from the current arena because it used [`sun-original.md`](./prompts/sun-original.md), not Frontier V2.

## What this benchmark tests

The task asks a model to turn a dense product specification into a complete browser-based Solar System experience rather than a thin demo. It stresses interpretation of the specification, visual/product judgment, orbital and time state, nested systems such as Earth–Moon, camera/navigation, scale and measurement tools, performance, reliability, accessibility, scientific honesty and validation.

## Frontier V2 scores

> **Preliminary evaluation:** the scores are mainly based on one evaluator and a limited number of devices/environments.

## Evaluation criteria — summary

- **Feature completeness — 20:** required features must exist and deliver the intended behavior; fake, shallow or loophole-driven implementations lose points.
- **Interaction / UX — 15:** clarity, discoverability, ergonomics and control flow when the product works as designed; ordinary implementation bugs belong to Robustness.
- **Visual execution — 15:** hierarchy, readability, coherence, rendering quality and polish.
- **Scientific / simulation fidelity — 15:** orbital, temporal, scale and astronomical correctness plus honest approximation boundaries.
- **Robustness — 10:** bugs, desynchronization, broken camera/follow state, exceptions, corrupted state and behaviors that stop working.
- **Performance — 10:** responsiveness, frame pacing, loading and resource efficiency.
- **Code / architecture — 10:** maintainability, modularity, state boundaries, dependency discipline, testability and validation quality.
- **Accessibility / responsive behavior — 5:** keyboard/focus access, reduced motion, semantic usability and layout adaptation.

**No double penalty:** a defect is scored in its primary category unless separate evidence proves an independent second violation. A broken Sun-follow/camera state, for example, is **Robustness**, not UX.

See [`comparison/SCORECARD.md`](./comparison/SCORECARD.md) for detailed evidence and per-category scores.

## Snapshot policy

Model-produced files are preserved inside `runs/` without evaluator edits. Evaluator-authored material stays outside those snapshots.

## Fairness

A contender should not receive another contender's implementation, score, critique or post-hoc hints while generating its own project. The benchmark is **generation first, evaluation second**.
